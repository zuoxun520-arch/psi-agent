"""SSE stream processing for ChannelCore: parsing and interval buffering.

Two transport-agnostic units, separated from ``ChannelCore`` so each can be
unit-tested without HTTP/sockets:

- ``iter_sse_events`` — turns a raw byte-line stream into validated ``delta``
  dicts (handles ``data:`` framing, ``[DONE]``, heartbeats, error chunks).
- ``StreamBuffer`` — merges a ``(kind, text)`` event stream into interval-sized
  blocks (flushed on kind switch, on the next ``append`` after the interval, or at
  stream end).

class StreamBuffer:
    """Throttle a streamed ``(kind, text)`` sequence into interval-sized blocks.

    **Why it exists.** ``ChannelCore.post`` receives the AI reply as many tiny SSE
    deltas. Pushing every token straight to a chat UI would hit rate limits and
    flicker (Telegram ``edit_text``, Feishu card refresh). ``StreamBuffer``
    coalesces consecutive tokens of the *same kind* arriving within ``interval``
    seconds into one block, so the UI updates at most ~once per ``interval``.
    Terminal channels (CLI/REPL) pass ``interval=0`` to disable batching and emit
    every token immediately.

    **Input.** The caller drives the buffer per SSE delta: ``switch(kind)``
    declares the kind of the text about to arrive (``"reasoning"`` vs anything
    else, treated as content), then ``append(text)`` adds that text. ``flush()``
    is called once when the stream ends.

    **Output.** Every method returns ``list[tuple[str, str]]`` — the ``(kind,
    merged_text)`` blocks to emit *right now* (in practice 0 or 1). The kind is
    always a real ``str``: a block is only emitted after a ``switch`` has set it,
    so the public output never carries the ``None`` that the internal ``_kind``
    holds before the first ``switch``. The caller maps each block to a
    ``TextChunk`` / ``ReasoningChunk``. Returning "what to emit now" instead of
    being an async generator lets ``post`` interleave these blocks with the
    ``FileChunk``s from ``SendMarkerScanner`` in arrival order from a single loop;
    doing no I/O keeps it synchronous and unit-testable without an event loop.

    **Kind switching.** Changing kind flushes the previous kind's buffer first:
    ``reasoning`` and content are distinct output types that must never be merged,
    and flushing on the boundary also preserves arrival order.

    **Timing (deliberately simple).** The interval is a *lazy* window checked only
    inside ``append`` — there is no background timer. A block is emitted on the
    first ``append`` after the window elapses (or at the next ``switch`` / at
    ``flush``), not exactly at the window edge. This avoids an extra anyio task and
    its cancellation surface; ``flush()`` always drains the tail at stream end. One
    ``StreamBuffer`` is created per ``post()`` call, so state never crosses requests.
